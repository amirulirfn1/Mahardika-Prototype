## Style Guidelines:

- Use a main color palette of blues and greens to evoke trust and stability.
- Neutral backgrounds (whites, light grays) to ensure content is easily readable and not distracting.
- Use an accent color like a vibrant teal (#008080) for interactive elements.
- Maintain consistent heading styles with clear hierarchy. Use a limited number of font sizes and weights for clarity.
- Consistent icon set across the application to ensure intuitive navigation and quick identification of features. Use icons that are simple, clear, and easily recognizable.
- Consistent layout across different pages, utilizing grid systems to align elements properly. Employ adequate whitespace to separate different content blocks.
- Use animations sparingly, focusing on subtle transitions to enhance user experience without overwhelming them. Employ animations for loading states, form submissions, and navigation transitions.
